# dynamic-sentiment-AVs
## üéØ Description
An end-user sentiment assessment tool to predict autonomous vehicles (AVs) adoption and commercialization.

## üí≠ Scope definition and purpose
Our study complements previous research on social media platform user sentiment on AVs by (a) introducing a dynamic component by observing sentiment across time and critical news events, (b) correlating key user-discussed topics with shifts in user sentiment, and (c) predicting user sentiment based on news‚Äô underlying topic assessment. We will leverage NewsCatcherAPI to extract filtered topic-specific news posts from the last 5 years to train a  model using topic scores for sentiment prediction.
